# We want to call nexus3-oss role at ansible-thoteam.nexus3-oss and the role specifies a multitude of default
# variables, at ansible-thoteam.nexus3-oss/defaults/main.yml.
# Redefining a variable declared in a role does not supersede the role default variables, unless it is manually
# specified in the 'vars' field.
# To streamline this process, we run through all variables that we define named "nexus_.*" (which obey ansible
# variable precedence), and inject them as facts. Doing so, allows us to override the value of a default variable
# in the included role.
# Also, to allow us to compose variables from variables that exist in included role's defaults but we don't override
# in our role's defaults, we call a dummy bootstrap task with 'public: true' to export those variables first.
