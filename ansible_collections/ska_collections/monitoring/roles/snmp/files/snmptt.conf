SDESC
A coldStart trap signifies that the SNMPv2 entity, acting
in an agent role, is reinitializing itself and that its
configuration may have been altered.

EVENT linkDown .1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.3 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT Link down on interface $1.  Admin state: $2.  Operational state: $3 
#EXEC qpage -f TRAP notifygroup1 "Link down on interface $1.  Admin state: $2.  Operational state: $3"
SDESC
A linkDown trap signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in
an agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for
one of its communication links is about to enter the down
state from some other state (but not from the notPresent
state).  This other state is indicated by the included value
of ifOperStatus.

FORMAT Link up on interface $1.  Admin state: $2.  Operational state: $3
#EXEC qpage -f TRAP notifygroup1 "Link up on interface $1.  Admin state: $2.  Operational state: $3"
SDESC
A linkUp trap signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in an
agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for
one of its communication links left the down state and
transitioned into some other state (but not into the
notPresent state).  This other state is indicated by the
included value of ifOperStatus.

SDESC
An authenticationFailure trap signifies that the SNMPv2
entity, acting in an agent role, has received a protocol
message that is not properly authenticated.  While all
implementations of the SNMPv2 must be capable of generating
this trap, the snmpEnableAuthenTraps object indicates
whether this trap will be generated.
